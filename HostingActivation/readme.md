#Service Fabric Hosting, Activation & Isolation Walkthrough#


This code is supporting a blog post published here http://henidak.com/2015/07/service-fabric-hosting-activation-isolation. if you want to run the walkthrough, clone the code to a service fabric dev machine, build it using VS.NET (don't deploy it) then run do-it.ps1 it will take you step by step through the exercise. 

Once done you can run un-do-it.ps1 which will clean your cluster from any application instance created during the exercise.
